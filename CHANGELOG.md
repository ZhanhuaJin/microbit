### Added

- Added support for the thumbv7em-none-eabi target for microbit:v2 (same as
  thumbv7em-none-eabihf but without hardware floating point support)

### Changed

- Rearrange LED display modules under the same root module and change their
  APIs to be more aligned with each other.
- Add BLE Beacon demo.
- Add a simple speaker demo for micro:bit V2.
- Add Board struct following the pattern used in other nrf board support crates.
- Add magnetometer example.
- LEDs on the micro:bit V1 are now turned off per default
- UART(E) is now exposed in the same way as I2C

## [0.10.1] - 2021-05-25

Republished without changes to fix missing README.md in crates.io.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-05-13

## [0.9.0] - 2021-04-29

### Added

- Add `microbit::gpio` module with pins mapped to micro:bit names
- Refactor `microbit::display` and `microbit::led` to accept `gpio::Pins`
